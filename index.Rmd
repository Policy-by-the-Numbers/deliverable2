This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}
# clean memory
rm(list = ls())

# reading in data via Github link
file <-("https://github.com/Policy-by-the-Numbers/deliverable2/raw/main/deli2dataset_new.csv")
data <-read.csv(file, row.names=NULL)

# reset indexes to R paradigm


#check data types
str(data)

```
```{r}
# Preparing data

# I think we want to keep all of these variables but the name
clusterData=data[,c(2:13)]

#save the country names as the row index
row.names(clusterData)=data$name

clusterData
```

## FACTOR ANALYSIS

1. Subset original data frame
```{r}
FAdata=clusterData

```

2. Compute correlations
```{r}
library(polycor)
corMatrix=polycor::hetcor(FAdata)$correlations

# visualizing matrix
library(ggcorrplot)

ggcorrplot(corMatrix,
           type = "lower") + 
          theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(size = 5),
                axis.text.y  = element_text(size = 5))

# looks terrible tbh
```

3. check conditions

```{r}
# the amount of data should be enough for the correlation process:
library(psych)
psych::KMO(corMatrix)

# note: does not meet the threshold for KMO
```

The correlation matrix should not be an identity matrix:
```{r}
# is identity matrix?
cortest.bartlett(corMatrix,n=nrow(FAdata))$p.value>0.05
```

The correlation matrix should not be singular
```{r}
library(matrixcalc)

is.singular.matrix(corMatrix)
```
4. Get suggestions for amount of factors
```{r}
fa.parallel(FAdata, fa = 'fa',correct = T,plot = F)
```
5. Compute the factors
```{r}
library(GPArotation)
resfa <- fa(FAdata,
            nfactors = 5,
            cor = 'mixed',
            rotate = "varimax",
            fm="minres")

```

6. Explore results
```{r}
### see results
print(resfa$loadings,cutoff = 0.5)
```

```{r}
fa.diagram(resfa,main = "EFA results")
```
8. Improving factor analysis
```{r}
ps=c("mtonsco2emissions", "alcliterspercapita", "percentgdpmilitary", "internetusers")
notPs=setdiff(names(FAdata),ps)
FAdata2=FAdata[,notPs]
```

recompute correlations
```{r}
library(polycor)
corMatrix2=polycor::hetcor(FAdata2)$correlations
```

Recheck conditions: MSA
```{r}
library(psych)
psych::KMO(corMatrix2) 
# MSA improved! barely meets threshold!
```
Recheck conditions: bartlett
```{r}
cortest.bartlett(corMatrix2,n=nrow(FAdata2))$p.value>0.05
```
Recheck conditions: singularity
```{r}
library(matrixcalc)

is.singular.matrix(corMatrix2)
```

Now get new suggestions
```{r}
fa.parallel(FAdata2, fa = 'fa',correct = T,plot = F)
```
Compute factors again
```{r}
library(GPArotation)
resfa <- fa(FAdata2,
            nfactors = 3,
            cor = 'mixed',
            rotate = "varimax",
            fm="minres")
# Displaying results
fa.diagram(resfa,main = "EFA results (2)")
```

We end up with three factors: MR1 has child mortality rate, total fertility rate, education expeditures (negatively correlated) and energy consumption per capita (negatively correlated) as components, MR2 has net migration rate and inflation rate as components, and MR3 has unemployment rate and gini coefficent as components. I hypothesize that MR1 represents the latent concept of a country's development level as I expect chid mortality rate and total fertility rate to be positively correlated with development level and education expenditures and energy consumption to be negatively correlated with a country's development level. I hypothesize that MR3 represents a country's inequality, as that factor is positively correlated with the Gini coefficient and unemployment rate. This is a stretch but I hypothesize MR2 to represent scarcity, as scarcity is positively correlated with inflation rate and migration rate. It should be noted though, that with an MSA of 0.61, the factor scores are likely not completely accurate.
